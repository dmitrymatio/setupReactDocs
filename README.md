## How we collaborate during this time?

In the first couple of weeks, we were completing this guide face to face. Then the spring break came, we all agreed that we could just communicate through slack. However, due to the increasing case with COVID-19 we have to finish this guide remotely. Although we are using Github pages to build up our guide, the communication between us is still slower than face to face. Thankfully that we already discuss each person's role before the spring break come, so even we have to work remotely does not effect a lot of things.

## What are the techniques we face when finishing the guide?

One technique we used in the guide is that we use an HTML image tag to server the note/warning picture. The reason is that we can use a border to wrap around the picture and the text, visually it looks better.

## What are the difficulties we face when we are testing our guide ,and how did we resolve that?

The significant difficulty is that the supporting instruction we are using for the installation section is outdated, and the instruction did not provide any of the troubleshooting guides. We spend hours of times searching for the solution online. After hours of digging, we finally found the problem; the problem is that the package they were using in the instruction is no longer supported. Therefore, we update all the packages to the supported one and configure the whole thing again. Finally, we got it working and rewrite the whole installation section.
